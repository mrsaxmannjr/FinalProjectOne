                <p class="para"> Building things have always interested me. Playing make believe as a child, bringing dolls to life was just the start.
                    As I got older I started painting in abstract design. At age 20, I wrote a 120 page screenplay and incorporated four languages
                    weaved throughout. Traveling to a myriad of places inspires my design. Being engulfed in business at Hewlett-Packard 
                    and Gartner gave me insight into what it takes to be a Fortune 20 and Fortune 50 company. Working for a British firm gave 
                    me international exposure on their strategy and the rollercoaster ride of expansion into new markets.
                    I graduated with a B.A. in Public Relations from Bradley University (Illinois, USA). A Minnesota native, I moved after college
                    for a job with Hewlett-Packard to Arkansas. I then moved to Naples, Florida to work for Gartner. 
                    I am currently located in the Denver metro studying software development at the Galvanize Platte campus. I am so happy in this field that
                    I wake up before my alarm. This community allows me to build, inspire others and create innovative products.

                    <p class="para"> Diving into the development world I realized the opportunities to merge my software interest
                         with robotics. After meeting a Colorado robotics company's product robot it became something that I explored for myself.
                        I attend robotics meetups and would like to get involved in the area of combining sports
                        training machines and robotics. As an avid tennis player, I was pleasantly surprised to see a machine that will pick
                        up the tennis balls for you. Drone technology fascinates me. I am keen on understanding
                         how drones can be used to assist in natural disasters.
